&lt;p&gt;But you won&amp;#39;t be able to learn CompSci by going through a dictionary of algorithms  methodically the same way you won&amp;#39;t be able to learn English by starting with aardvark. The definition will contain base word definitions (e.g. &amp;#39;animal&amp;#39; in case of aardvark) which you will then have to reference  - then reference the references&amp;#39; references and so on &amp;#39;till you get to the word &amp;#39;word&amp;#39; which will contain references to &amp;#39;sentence&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;structure&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point it should become apparent (if it hasn&amp;#39;t by then) that going through the dictionary in any order (grouped alphabetically or otherwise) in order to learn a language is a bad idea.

Everyone in that class submitted functions that took in a game state and a teammmate state and output the move that that teammember took on that tick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty cool place to start in AI. Q-Learning essentially lets an agent teach itself the game by running many iterations to develop a &amp;quot;policy&amp;quot; for the game world. It can use this learned policy to play successful games. Did a project on it recently for my AI course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A portion of the Q-Learning process is to have some probability that it will follow the currently developing policy or just make some random movements in an attempt to learn a better sequence of actions.&lt;/p&gt;

Why span a LB across regions you don&amp;#39;t need in case of failure when you can just have the bare minimum running so you can quickly scale up when load is reallocated?  That&amp;#39;s much cheaper for that kind of redundancy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to dynamically balance across Regions in case of failure so you don&amp;#39;t have to micromanage it, you can use round robin DNS.  It&amp;#39;s a bit of a hack.  A better solution is to script your Elastic IP to reassign but you have to either babysit this script or make it smart about running multiple copies of the script across regions, think hive mind or master election.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would have to have a recent image. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think you need any recent image and I&amp;#39;m not sure how you came to that conclusion because I didn&amp;#39;t really talk about the actual implementation at a low enough level. Your operational states should not be stored in the image &lt;strong&gt;at all&lt;/strong&gt;, as SOP for instances dictates, as they can go down at any time.  The image should be working like a stateless machine, data in, data out. Your data about your state can be stored in your database or a SQS. The exception to this is if you&amp;#39;re using some kind of hivemind to store operational state, but obviously that should be getting backed up regularly*. Otherwise, the script is small and copy-pasteable and stored anywhere and everywhere and ran manually. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*although I&amp;#39;m not sure why you would backup your hivemind, it just seems like a good idea. In theory, the hive mind never dies and if it does it doesn&amp;#39;t matter because everyone is literally dead.  But if it gets corrupted you can use the backup to revert, but then your state and what state you think you are in is inconsistent and that can be very bad.&lt;/p&gt;

Also planning for disaster in AWS is not that hard, it is very natural. We started with zero experience and this is our design: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have 12 application servers 4x3az. All our applications are just computing brokers, aka they don&amp;#39;t save any data, and the instructions (application code) are fed to them during startup which is sourced from a central git repo.&lt;br/&gt;
An app server is built from a instance-store image (migratable, although EBS is migratable now) and the code is fetched from a Git repository. All the UGC (images, documents) are stored in S3 via the API. The DNS roundrobins between three zones and the load balancer  (ELB) balances between the four app servers within a zone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UGC: Stored in S3 via API
Sessions: Sessions are stored in multiAZ dynamodb via API 
Database: We use multiAZ RDS to store data via mysql connector&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a Zonal outage, we loose 4 app servers and we immediately build four more (2x2az); Now, as we have the image (IS) up2date, creating an instance is very fast (&amp;lt;3min) and we create all four in parallel &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if we loose two zones our application can survive with 12 app servers in one zone temporarily. Also, the probability of loosing two zones at a time is very very very low. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the probability of loosing two zones at a time is very very very low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory. In practice everyone else has the same fallback scripts as you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As has been shown during previous outages, when an AZ goes down the load on the other AZs increases massively as everyone tries to spin up instances in those AZs. So in practice, you may not be able to create new instances in other AZs because of the load. Or you may but it may take a lot longer than you assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

380,4,c9dv0w3,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree and thats why I planned with &amp;quot;run instances to handle maximum load&amp;quot; principle. 
[I forgot to mention that initially we were at 3x3 and based on the fact that the AZes become overloaded during disaster and we may not have OPS people to build instances immediately (we don&amp;#39;t autoscale) we changed from 3x3 to 4x3]
Our system can survive with 8 instances unless we get a peak load (&amp;lt;5% chance). This design will surely add redundancy most of the time but redundancy is a tradeoff for disaster planning.  &lt;/p&gt;

As your code grows you need new data types but also new operations to work on them. Depending on whether you organize your code by types or by behavior you&amp;#39;ll face different kinds of problems. So &amp;quot;encapsulate behavior behind types&amp;quot; is not a golden rule, even though it&amp;#39;s usually the best approach in OOP (because a class is the unit of abstraction). Note that some languages provide mechanisms to let the programmer decide from which &amp;quot;side&amp;quot; tackle the problem (typeclasses in Haskell, multimethods in some Lisps -not only Clojure, thanks @munificent-, ...).&lt;/p&gt;

448,8,c9d3ol5,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been learning AngularJS and my perception so far is that the complexities are there for good reason. There are constructs like directives that don&amp;#39;t exist in other frameworks. You have lots of local scopes all over the place and you are selectively binding data between them that originated who-knows-where and is being watched by who-knows-what. So there are some new challenges, but these new mechanisms really just exist as abstractions that help you scale your application up without losing its robustness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, someone trying to use traditional techniques in the Angular world is going to run into some walls. As the &lt;a href=""http://docs.angularjs.org/misc/faq""&gt;faq&lt;/a&gt; says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop trying to use jQuery to modify the DOM in controllers. Really. That includes adding elements, removing elements, retrieving their contents, showing and hiding them. Use built-in directives, or write your own where necessary, to do your DOM manipulation. See below about duplicating functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re struggling to break the habit, consider removing jQuery from your app. Really. Angular has the $http service and powerful directives that make it almost always unnecessary. Angular&amp;#39;s bundled jQLite has a handful of the features most commonly used in writing Angular directives, especially binding to events.&lt;/p&gt;

Then tried Ember but was &lt;a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/9981788/332516""&gt;a deer in headlights when looking at a Chosen implementation&lt;/a&gt; and the docs just sucked in organization and sometime explanation(maybe better now -- haven&amp;#39;t checked).  Then glanced at Angular and saw how directives worked and thought &amp;#39;wat?!&amp;#39;.  Went BACK to Backbone (no pun intended) and really tried to learn it this time and it was actually easier to grasp than I thought.   However,I found a lot of models,collections, and views involved some repetitive writing AND communicating between views became an issue without using something like &lt;a href=""http://marionettejs.com/""&gt;Marionette&lt;/a&gt;.  I almost gave up until I saw &lt;a href=""http://egghead.io""&gt;John Lindquist&amp;#39;s videos at egghead.io&lt;/a&gt;.  Finally, a light came on (&amp;quot;that is how scope in directives work?!&amp;quot;).  However, it took me awhile until I really understood how to organize my code between using directives, controllers, and services.  The thing with Angular is that there are TOO MANY options to use.  This is not a bad thing.  The two things with all of these frameworks that help make single page apps is the paradigm shift from sending  dynamic content mostly from the server AND the paradigm shift  from working from little modularity to working modularly with javascript which, IMHO, most js devs should strive for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many other well-known organizations, we face cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis. In mid-December, we detected a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating from China that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google. However, it soon became clear that what at first appeared to be solely a security incident--albeit a significant one--was something quite different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, this attack was not just on Google. As part of our investigation we have discovered that at least twenty other large companies from a wide range of businesses--including the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectors--have been similarly targeted. We are currently in the process of notifying those companies, and we are also working with the relevant U.S. authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we have evidence to suggest that a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. Based on our investigation to date we believe their attack did not achieve that objective. Only two Gmail accounts appear to have been accessed, and that activity was limited to account information (such as the date the account was created) and subject line, rather than the content of emails themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, as part of this investigation but independent of the attack on Google, we have discovered that the accounts of dozens of U.S.-, China- and Europe-based Gmail users who are advocates of human rights in China appear to have been routinely accessed by third parties. These accounts have not been accessed through any security breach at Google, but most likely via phishing scams or malware placed on the users&amp;#39; computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have already used information gained from this attack to make infrastructure and architectural improvements that enhance security for Google and for our users. In terms of individual users, we would advise people to deploy reputable anti-virus and anti-spyware programs on their computers, to install patches for their operating systems and to update their web browsers. Always be cautious when clicking on links appearing in instant messages and emails, or when asked to share personal information like passwords online. You can read more here about our cyber-security recommendations. People wanting to learn more about these kinds of attacks can read this U.S. government report (PDF), Nart Villeneuve&amp;#39;s blog and this presentation on the GhostNet spying incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have taken the unusual step of sharing information about these attacks with a broad audience not just because of the security and human rights implications of what we have unearthed, but also because this information goes to the heart of a much bigger global debate about freedom of speech. In the last two decades, China&amp;#39;s economic reform programs and its citizens&amp;#39; entrepreneurial flair have lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese people out of poverty. Indeed, this great nation is at the heart of much economic progress and development in the world today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We launched Google.cn in January 2006 in the belief that the benefits of increased access to information for people in China and a more open Internet outweighed our discomfort in agreeing to censor some results. At the time we made clear that &amp;quot;we will carefully monitor conditions in China, including new laws and other restrictions on our services. If we determine that we are unable to achieve the objectives outlined we will not hesitate to reconsider our approach to China.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These attacks and the surveillance they have uncovered--combined with the attempts over the past year to further limit free speech on the web--have led us to conclude that we should review the feasibility of our business operations in China. We have decided we are no longer willing to continue censoring our results on Google.cn, and so over the next few weeks we will be discussing with the Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine within the law, if at all. We recognize that this may well mean having to shut down Google.cn, and potentially our offices in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to review our business operations in China has been incredibly hard, and we know that it will have potentially far-reaching consequences. We want to make clear that this move was driven by our executives in the United States, without the knowledge or involvement of our employees in China who have worked incredibly hard to make Google.cn the success it is today. We are committed to working responsibly to resolve the very difficult issues raised.&lt;/p&gt;

523,54,c0iprgl,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree -- tor is very, very slow. ssh tunneling is a much better solution for hiding your web browsing. The technique is OS-dependent; if you&amp;#39;re using Windows, you should download PuTTy; if you are using Linux, BSD, or Mac OS X, you already have openssh installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;here are a couple of tutorials on getting this working:
&lt;a href=""http://thinkhole.org/wp/2006/05/10/howto-secure-firefox-and-im-with-putty/""&gt;http://thinkhole.org/wp/2006/05/10/howto-secure-firefox-and-im-with-putty/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another step to this, which is mentioned in neither of the articles I linked, is to forward DNS queries through the tunnel to the remote server. This can be accomplished by going to about:config, and double-clicking network.proxy.socks_remote_dns to turn it on. Now, the web address of the site you are browsing is hidden from any possible snoopers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you would still need to find a non-chinese shell server online..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Terms you want to exclude (-)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attaching a minus sign immediately before a word indicates that you do not want pages that contain this word to appear in your results. The minus sign should appear immediately before the word and should be preceded with a space. For example, in the query [ anti-virus software ], the minus sign is used as a hyphen and will not be interpreted as an exclusion symbol; whereas the query [ anti-virus -software ] will search for the words &amp;#39;anti-virus&amp;#39; but exclude references to software. You can exclude as many words as you want by using the - sign in front of all of them, for example [ jaguar -cars -football -os ]. The - sign can be used to exclude more than just words. For example, place a hyphen before the &amp;#39;site:&amp;#39; operator (without a space) to exclude a specific site from your search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance compare &lt;a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=reddit+look+of+disapproval+narwhals+pie+ama+omg+lol""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; (sorry for the weird query, I just added a bunch of words together until I got only a few results) to &lt;a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=reddit+look+of+disapproval+narwhals+pie+ama+omg+lol+-coat""&gt;the same search with -coat at the end&lt;/a&gt; - the first result is missing completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A new approach to China&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1/12/2010 03:00:00 PM 
Like many other well-known organizations, we face cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis. In mid-December, we detected a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating from China that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google. However, it soon became clear that what at first appeared to be solely a security incident--albeit a significant one--was something quite different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, this attack was not just on Google. As part of our investigation we have discovered that at least twenty other large companies from a wide range of businesses--including the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectors--have been similarly targeted. We are currently in the process of notifying those companies, and we are also working with the relevant U.S. authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we have evidence to suggest that a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. Based on our investigation to date we believe their attack did not achieve that objective. Only two Gmail accounts appear to have been accessed, and that activity was limited to account information (such as the date the account was created) and subject line, rather than the content of emails themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, as part of this investigation but independent of the attack on Google, we have discovered that the accounts of dozens of U.S.-, China- and Europe-based Gmail users who are advocates of human rights in China appear to have been routinely accessed by third parties. These accounts have not been accessed through any security breach at Google, but most likely via phishing scams or malware placed on the users&amp;#39; computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have already used information gained from this attack to make infrastructure and architectural improvements that enhance security for Google and for our users. In terms of individual users, we would advise people to deploy reputable anti-virus and anti-spyware programs on their computers, to install patches for their operating systems and to update their web browsers. Always be cautious when clicking on links appearing in instant messages and emails, or when asked to share personal information like passwords online. You can read more here about our cyber-security recommendations. People wanting to learn more about these kinds of attacks can read this U.S. government report (PDF), Nart Villeneuve&amp;#39;s blog and this presentation on the GhostNet spying incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have taken the unusual step of sharing information about these attacks with a broad audience not just because of the security and human rights implications of what we have unearthed, but also because this information goes to the heart of a much bigger global debate about freedom of speech. In the last two decades, China&amp;#39;s economic reform programs and its citizens&amp;#39; entrepreneurial flair have lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese people out of poverty. Indeed, this great nation is at the heart of much economic progress and development in the world today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We launched Google.cn in January 2006 in the belief that the benefits of increased access to information for people in China and a more open Internet outweighed our discomfort in agreeing to censor some results. At the time we made clear that &amp;quot;we will carefully monitor conditions in China, including new laws and other restrictions on our services. If we determine that we are unable to achieve the objectives outlined we will not hesitate to reconsider our approach to China.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These attacks and the surveillance they have uncovered--combined with the attempts over the past year to further limit free speech on the web--have led us to conclude that we should review the feasibility of our business operations in China. We have decided we are no longer willing to continue censoring our results on Google.cn, and so over the next few weeks we will be discussing with the Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine within the law, if at all. We recognize that this may well mean having to shut down Google.cn, and potentially our offices in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to review our business operations in China has been incredibly hard, and we know that it will have potentially far-reaching consequences. We want to make clear that this move was driven by our executives in the United States, without the knowledge or involvement of our employees in China who have worked incredibly hard to make Google.cn the success it is today. We are committed to working responsibly to resolve the very difficult issues raised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your point seemed to be (as far as I could tell), with a large enough event, the public would be aware of a brutal governmental overreaction, and the aftermath would result in appropriate protection of civil liberties (e.g. stopping &amp;quot;shit like ACTA and the full-body scanners&amp;quot;).

Political change on that scale depends on so many factors that are impossible to predict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to it, I suspect that if the BBC came to America and started asking random people about the genocide of the Native Americans, a lot of people would be willing to ignore the issue in front of the nasty foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;

For older people, they are used to the abuse of the power, the inequality of the society. Among others, the censorship of Internet is the last thing they will worry about.
Human Right is just not that important in their mind. From outside, China is big and strong. But inside, it&amp;#39;s still just a big developing country. With the great economic growth in China, it would be hard to see widespread unrest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn&amp;#39;t this basically be true of any form of censorship?  If your argument explains why internet censorship would fail, shouldn&amp;#39;t most other forms of censorship be unsuccessful for similar reasons?  And yet, censorship has been done before, and is being done presently, and it seems possible to make it work.  If you create enough of a climate of fear and conformity, people won&amp;#39;t stand up against censorship enough to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reputation risk.&lt;/strong&gt; They were willing to take the black eye of censoring themselves, but they won&amp;#39;t tolerate security breaches that make their system look unreliable everywhere. This one incident is just what we&amp;#39;ve heard about, surely there is more fucked up shit going on that&amp;#39;s not public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low upside.&lt;/strong&gt; Google isn&amp;#39;t making any money in China, and Chinese people will probably prefer a Chinese copy to any new product Google promotes in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule of law.&lt;/strong&gt; Even if Google somehow manages to create a money-making product, they can&amp;#39;t trust the Chinese government to not take it away. The government is not very fond of foreigners making money in China, and they&amp;#39;re not afraid to change the rules to screw them over. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The China story.&lt;/strong&gt; China may become the next super power. (Most of Reddit seems to think so.) Or issues like the reasons above may prevent it from becoming a sustainable modern economy. (Most traders I&amp;#39;ve heard talk about it think so.) No one knows, and there are arguments for either side. It&amp;#39;s possible the guys in charge at Google have swung from a positive to a negative view on the outlook of the Chinese economy as a whole, so that doing business there is no longer a priority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing is for sure: the news is big and Google would not do this unless there was real motivation for it. Google is a publicly traded company, they owe explanations to their stockholders and idealistic morality games do not increase the bottom line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Negative. This is economic warfare; the real issue here is the theft of intellectual property. The media byline is that human rights activists were involved. If human rights were ever a concern of google&amp;#39;s or any other transnational, they wouldn&amp;#39;t be doing business in China in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not necessarily true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to be an idealist when you&amp;#39;re not the one making big decisions. And I&amp;#39;m not saying that Google necessarily did the right thing in the first place. But I think they made a pretty good argument back in 2006 when they first opened up shop in China: they were compromising in order to get their foot in the door, instead of refusing to compromise and not being allowed in. I think they hoped that once they got that foot in, then they might be able to help gradually open things up. Clearly they&amp;#39;re rethinking that decision now, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean they were wrong to try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly they&amp;#39;re rethinking that decision now, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean they were wrong to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, why do you think they&amp;#39;re rethinking the decision? This may be exactly what they had in mind: wait until they capture a large market share in China (1/3rd more or less) with their multitude of apps, and then pull out all stops on censorship. Chinese people would be up in revolt if all of Google was blocked only because the Chinese govt. wanted a few images censored. With so many websites out there, there&amp;#39;s no way the Chinese government could keep it under wraps like they did Tiananmen. So I would call this a noble, risky, not-without-financial-gain move rather than a purely noble one. This particular hackery incident seems minor and not-too-uncommon (from the POV of a multinational corporation), but it may just be the trigger they&amp;#39;ve been waiting for before announcing their no-censorship plans: the incident is sensitive enough (human rights!) to get them a lot of favor, and serves as a good reason for saying &amp;quot;enough is enough!&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I love Google as much as the next person, but please realize that no big corporation makes emotional &amp;quot;oh my god you hacked human rights activists&amp;#39; accounts! we&amp;#39;re leaving!&amp;quot; decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

946,54,c0iobfl,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hasn&amp;#39;t Yahoo been vastly less principled with respect to human rights in China? I think one argument to be made is that they may have introduced many Chinese to their better search results. It supposedly is not very difficult for people to get around the &amp;quot;great firewall&amp;quot;, but they will only make the effort to learn how if they feel they are missing something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds like it is in both parties&amp;#39; best interests to figure out how to make up. Hardliners in the Chinese government would rather that fewer people are compelled to search out ways around the great firewall, and Google can only generate ad revenues in China if they also have active operations in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From having seen many of the players in this issue speak, I think there are two points that will outweigh everything else. First, the author credits China on raising hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the past few decades (something unprecedented in human history), and second, China apparently overstepped some line with regard to attempts at breaking the security of multiple corporations that are both outside of China and integral to the functioning of the global system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words it is in China&amp;#39;s, and the prosperous West&amp;#39;s, best interest that China continue to rise, as the wealth of Chinese citizens increases that of citizens around the world, so they will do little if anything to destabilize the order that seems to be making it possible. The other point is that they have drawn a line. Apparently, they and other corporations will expose the lawlessness that governments regularly undertake within their own borders, if the operations extend beyond their borders, and they undermine and threaten the global system. At least I think that is the content of the message I think they are trying to deliver to China, and it may make less sense if one considers the reach of NSA intelligence gathering or other organizations in the west.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;not so sure. when you donate to charity, there&amp;#39;s an obvious benefit to that. in my opinion, this is why we should applaud it: the benefit derived from the action. how does Google pulling out of China help anybody? if anyone can think of a reason, please share. i&amp;#39;m not sure Google pulling its search out of China, filtered though it may be, is going to benefit anyone except (potentially) Google, who (might) reduce its risk of stolen IP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it was, how does their action prevent this from happening in the future? Censor or not, people can still hack and try to steal IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;great question, and i don&amp;#39;t have a crisp answer. the only thing i can imagine is that maybe the physical location of Google&amp;#39;s servers had some bearing on the attack, and that Google will be less susceptible to such attacks by moving its servers. again, not a great argument, but it&amp;#39;s all i can see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think there is no greater benefit than knowledge and no greater evil than the seduction of ignorance. (Maybe you don&amp;#39;t agree fully with me--but surely, partially?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many things can come from liberation of ignorance, and Google&amp;#39;s highly publicized stance can reasonably be said to further that liberation. Maybe it will create a domino effect, and maybe it won&amp;#39;t, but it has already received attention from the State Department, and you know further investigation is going to come from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If nothing else, light will be cast upon an organization that is corrupt, and perhaps it will convince others--not necessarily &amp;quot;important&amp;quot; people--of this same fact that might not have known it before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an historical example of the power of knowledge, you needn&amp;#39;t look any further than a &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Sense_(pamphlet""&gt;pamphlet published anonymously in 1776&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was with you until this part.  No country is blameless, but that does not mean that all countries are equally good/bad.  It&amp;#39;s still possible for a country to have blood on their hands and yet be a better or worse government than some other government.  In a prison, no inmate is blameless (except if the courts screwed up), but one inmate may have robbed a liquor store while another murdered 3 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries aren&amp;#39;t good or bad, countries have interests. The USA has a decent judicial system for its citizens, yet tons of crimes were commited outside the USA. That&amp;#39;s just one example, you could say the same about Germany, China, Russia, France, Portugal and on and on and on....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no good and bad, there are good actions, bad actions. Countries can do good things, bad things. Iraq 2003 was bad, D-Day 1945 was good, etc....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I say no country holds a moral higher ground means that no country is always right and doing good. Israel is an overall excellent country, world class universities, nice people, etc...but they have their occasions where we go WTF are they doing there... So that&amp;#39;s just how politics work.&lt;/p&gt;
