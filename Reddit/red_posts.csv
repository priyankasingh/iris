84,arc79,"Reddit, I got the best present a girl developer could ever want. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, to give you a little background me and this guy went on a few dates and he moved far away. We got along well, things didn&amp;#39;t get very far. He is really nice, however, I wasn&amp;#39;t leaning one way or the other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sent me the Post Secret books for xmas. He hinted at another present, but said I had to wait. It&amp;#39;s a little after Christmas, but I got this email yesterday with the title &amp;quot;I wanted to make something for you for Christmas&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So I told the computer, and it showed me how to write a poem in byte-form.  I can&amp;#39;t tell what you&amp;#39;re thinking these days, but this will either remind you of something that was good, or send you off.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It included a link to a poem.zip file, which I downloaded. Inside, there was a file called magicfile with no extension and a ReadMe that said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Intructions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1: &amp;gt; copy magicfile magicfile.jpg
 2: &amp;gt; copy magicfile magicfile.zip
 ... skip a few ...
 X: Ask it for help&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I renamed magicfile it turned into a picture of me! (a bad one that he took, but ok) and when I changed magicfile to a .zip inside it contained: Magicfile.exe and a txt called &amp;quot;Go Ahead&amp;quot; that said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s safe.  Requires WPF and .Net 3.5 I think...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever, it works on my machine.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opened magicfile, and an interface popped up that said &amp;quot;enter a passphrase&amp;quot;. So, I typed in &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; and got this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hi Sara!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you are just about figuring out, this is just the very beginning of a very, very large rabbit hole you&amp;#39;re about to fall into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, sometime in early November, I had an idea for an awesome program.  Simultaneously I was just beginning to think of what might be a decent Christmas present for you.  Put 2 and 2 together, and you get this thing.  I worked on it on and off for a few weeks - it was a pretty fun way to learn WPF and do a lot of interesting byte manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, it&amp;#39;s a completely self-contained magical file.  This magical file is three parts:
 1. If you name it .jpg - it&amp;#39;s an image!
 2. If you name it .zip - it&amp;#39;s a zip file, containing a program
 3. It&amp;#39;s a database of many, many more parts that the program reads&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when you run the program, it reads the magic file, and asks for a passphrase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re obviously gotten that far, or you wouldn&amp;#39;t be reading this.  As you can imagine - there are a bunch of passwords.  Not infinite, but many.  I encourage you to guess at words and try to figure them out.  I&amp;#39;ll give you the hints that they would be things relevant to you or to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a little ingenuity, you&amp;#39;ll be able to figure out a very important passphrase that will take you to the next step...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have gone on and solved some of the mysteries I have found that pictures of me come up, things he&amp;#39;s researched, things we did together and so on and so forth. I still am trying to figure out the important passphrase. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reddit, this is the most beautiful gift I have ever gotten and it leaves me in a funny place possibly going on the other side of the world to see what happens here. He is an avid redditor, and though I hate the &amp;quot;VOTE THIS UP, PLOX&amp;quot; posts I&amp;#39;d love to get this on the front page to show him what this meant. Thank you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nerd made a beautiful nerd gift for me, it was a program that was a mystery and shows things we did together. Please vote this up to show him how much it meant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of people are saying that the fact that I am unsure about what to do means I don&amp;#39;t like him. That is not at all the case, I like him a lot. I really enjoyed spending time with him, he is brilliant (there is nothing I like more than a man that can teach me things), funny, and best of all a great time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to go see him right now I have to take a 14hr plane flight. Which means I would be staying a week, and I&amp;#39;m not sure I&amp;#39;m quite at that point yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damnit, what do they say? &amp;quot;Explain the problem out loud to yourself&amp;quot; Alright, I&amp;#39;m going. There is no reason not to, this WAS awesome. I will let you folks know how it goes. &lt;/p&gt;

Its been so long since I&amp;#39;ve seen one it made me wonder how many of you out there have never seen one?  How many of you have ever seen one, but never used one?  How about 5.25&amp;quot;?  The 8&amp;quot; ones are before my time.  I&amp;#39;ve never seen one of those, although I have seen drives for them.  Bonus points if you&amp;#39;ve seen/used one of those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to bring it around, how long will it be that floppy disk icons become an abstract representation of the concept &amp;quot;save.&amp;quot;  Or are we already there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the whole story: &lt;a href=""http://www.theweinerworks.com/?p=86""&gt;http://www.theweinerworks.com/?p=86&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sites are down, so perhaps I can reach out through reddit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear dude who keeps hacking my sites,
A lot of people would take this opportunity to rant about hackers being dickheads. I&amp;#39;m not going to do that. It&amp;#39;s unproductive, and it fails to recognize the contributions hackers and ex-hackers have made to society. I firmly believe that a strong community of hackers is part of citizens&amp;#39; protection from government encroachment on freedom of speech online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, let me tell you why  you shouldn&amp;#39;t hack my site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the professional. Regardless of what you think of me personally (though I don&amp;#39;t know if this is whence the maliciousness), SMBC&amp;#39;s success helps a lot of people. I have a part time assistant and a business manager who make an important part of their income off my ad revenue. Whenever you knock down the site (or lessen its traffic by loading trojans), you decrease my income, and thereby decrease my ability to pay for these people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the success of SMBC helps pay for SMBC Theater. SMBC Theater is a project that, on any given weekend, might bring together one or two dozen talented people putting in their spare time for something they love. When you mess with my revenue stream, you also jeopardize that. Again, regardless of how you feel about me or that project, what you&amp;#39;re doing poses potential harm to a lot of nice, intelligent, hard working people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you knock down my servers, other websites go down as well. This includes Snowflakes, The Weinerworks, and Weinersmith. All of these are sites that I, James, Chris Jones, and Kelly work on without making much of return, and all of them are educational sites. When you down these, the way I see it, it makes the world a teeny tiny little bit worse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t consider myself to have a great amount of influence over the way people behave, but in my short career I have the privilege of helping a lot of young people. I&amp;#39;ve gotten countless emails from people saying I helped them through depression, inspired them to take on challenges, and encouraged them to stay in difficult academic programs. I don&amp;#39;t believe for a second that they did these things BECAUSE of me - nobody does anything hard without putting in the bulk of the effort  personally. But, I do believe SMBC provides a helpful service to a lot of good people, and I&amp;#39;m very lucky to be the conduit for that service. When you down my site (or any of the others), this goes away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect a lot of the above could be said about many websites, and that&amp;#39;s sort of my point. I understand hackers who try to get at sensitive information, or who try to harass jerks. I don&amp;#39;t understand what the value is in taking down a site like mine, which provides nothing but jokes and information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, whenever you hack my site, it causes a lot of anxiety for me, and for everyone who works with me. Right now, because of this latest attack, my brother (who was at work, and who has two lovely kids) had to run home to deal with this problem. In other words - when you attack my site, you&amp;#39;re not just attacking some abstract thing on the Internet. You&amp;#39;re causing physical distress to a lot of people who don&amp;#39;t deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So please, please just stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks,
Zach Weinersmith&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: When you hack my servers, you distress me and others physically and financially. We&amp;#39;re not a black box - we&amp;#39;re real people. So we&amp;#39;d all take it very kindly if you&amp;#39;d stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: Because this is reddit, I want to be clear: I&amp;#39;m not asking for any internet justice. Just sending a message in a bottle, hoping it falls into the right hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Holy crap! Thanks for all the upvotes and advice. I think we have resolved the problem, and I&amp;#39;ll see if I can get Marty (webmaster/brother) to post about it. Thanks nerds!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you bring up the very beginning of what you just coded, not even really describing what you did, just that you did it, and the eyes glaze over and silence arises. It&amp;#39;s mystifying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&amp;#39;m fairly interested in a lot of things. I&amp;#39;ll take a chance to hear about some geo-thermic shit, I play guitar so I want to know about some jazz chords, but I&amp;#39;ve yet to meet anyone outside of the programming world seem &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; interested in coding. It&amp;#39;s weird. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;m really trying to say is, when I finish something I&amp;#39;ve been coding for a while and I want to show it to someone in real life, I can&amp;#39;t (I never made friends in the comp. sci. dept. of my school, those guys are the most socially awkward people ever). My friend can show me the song he wrote, or my other friend can talk to me about some work he was doing with physics and the Tesla coil he built himself, but damn if some code I write isn&amp;#39;t worth the pixels it&amp;#39;s held on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m the programmer in the house, so whenever I say I&amp;#39;m coding they call it &amp;quot;1s and 0s&amp;quot; (indeed, my music major roommate and I even wrote a song about it called &amp;quot;Binary Blues&amp;quot;), &amp;quot;hax0ring&amp;quot; (we say that out loud). One of my roommate refers to everything I do as &amp;quot;buffering&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how to conclude this submission with anything worthwhile so I&amp;#39;ll just do it here. &lt;/p&gt;

him this open source Java framework","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was 27. His name is Le Quoc Chung. The cause was Adenocarcinoma, one of the rarest and worst form of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was a really dedicated programmer. His biggest and very own project, probably of his life, was &lt;a href=""http://code.google.com/p/jgentle/""&gt;JGentle&lt;/a&gt;. He always wanted me to be involved in the project, or at least help him on documentation and popularize it. I have never had a chance to help him enough though :(.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;99% of the code is his own, around 350.000 lines of code. It is (described by him)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JGentle&amp;#39;s features are referred to as Inversion of Control (IoC) Container or Lightweight Container. The adoption of JGentle in an application ensures the use of certain design principles which improve encapsulation, modularization, testability and reusability, offering configuration via Dependency Injection, Definition Management, Annotation Injection, and declarative services via AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main &lt;a href=""http://code.google.com/p/jgentle/""&gt;project homepage is here&lt;/a&gt;, and here is the &lt;a href=""http://code.google.com/p/jgentle/""&gt;Ohloh code review site&lt;/a&gt;. According to one of his tests vs. Spring framework, initialization of the container and getting 1000 beans procedures are faster than Spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am posting this with the hope to have your comments and reviews of the project, and also with the hope it will be useful to some of you. I think Chung will also be happy seeing his project being useful to the world. R.I.P, my cousin!&lt;/p&gt;
